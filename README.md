# MyGrowWithGoogleStory


This year has been a whirlwind of emotions that words won’t completely do justice to. I was tested mentally and physically in ways that nearly broke me. Some people say there are always lessons to be learned from our mistakes but sometimes there isn’t, somethings just happen. Shortly after graduating from college and finishing my internship at the NYC Mayor’s Office in 2017 I found that my Political Science degree meant nothing in the job market. I was consistently unemployed and underemployed and (in a twisted irony) dealing with food insecurity while working as a waiter in the food industry. In between choosing to pay bills or eat. I would ask myself how I got here…

I started my programming journey in January of 2018; a friend urged me to apply for the Grow With Google Scholarship. Soon afterward I learned that I was accepted into the program and was excited to learn something that could hopefully change the quality of my life. My body, unfortunately, wasn’t in agreement. My health was already deteriorating due to the demands of my job and my stress levels but my knees were rapidly failing in a way that I couldn’t understand. I was suspicious but deferred to the judgment of my physician. I can remember limping up and down the long hallways which felt like a lifetime at work. Fortunately, ten years in the hospitality industry gave me the experience to work efficiently enough that my supervisors would still often compliment my speed. At the end of each of those days I would hobble up the train station and limp back home to repeat the process and each day my body would cave in a little more. Not only were my knees getting worse but I had two herniated discs that gave me severe lower back pain. I could not sit for too long because my back would hurt but I couldn’t stand for too long because my knees would hurt too much. The only way I could work was by laying on my stomach every day for a few hours to avoid aggravating either. Eventually, my knees completely gave out on me and I couldn’t walk at all and had no income. For a few weeks Id use a crutch walk around and subsist on peanut butter and oatmeal. 

The Nanodegree program became the one thing in my life that I felt like I was making progress in so I latched on to it as if my life depended on it. To cope with the pain I took painkillers in the day drank vodka nightly. I subsisted on oatmeal and peanut butter and meditate on how my life could transform from being a developer. 

The rigor of the program was enough to also keep me distracted and focused while the rest of my life was in shambles. I loved solving problems, doing the assigned projects, reviewing topics on Codeburst and Free Code Camp. The chaos of my life was quieted with understanding Javascript, API’s, components, state and dreams of building applications that could transform people’s lives.  Eventually, I was able to undergo surgery to help repair my knee and had to take a 1-month hiatus from programming so I could return more focused and healthy. 


After my surgery, I began physical therapy and slowly stabilized support on my knees I was elated. Things were slowly but gradually getting better. I still had a pronounced limp and being inactive for such a long time worsened my back. In spite of my body failing me, financial hardships, anxiety and coping with repeated job rejections I was able to catch up and graduate on time.

Currently, I am trying to land an internship while trying to make ends meet, however, remain hopeful because of how far I’ve come and the supportive network of the Udacity community. I hope my story provides a little encouragement to other aspiring developers from underserved communities trying to rise above the conditions of their current circumstances.



Happy New Year’s,
